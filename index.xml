      <description>Creating the image (disk.raw) The fastest way of doing this (less than 1 hour &amp;ldquo;7min&amp;rdquo;) is to use AWS and chose the c4.8xlarge instance, at the moment of writhing this, is an instance with 36 vCPU / 60 RAM, the important thing to check for, is the amount of cores not really the memory. After finishing building, stop or terminate the build instance, mainly because is a very expensive instance and in best scenario you just want to do all this in less than 1 hour.</description>

      <description>DRAFT Download the image: disk.tar.gz
The image works in AWS, GCE, and other providers that allow custom images like vultr.com or netcup or locally by using VirtualBox
The advantage of using GCE google compute engine is that the image can be uploaded compressed tar.gz for other providers needs to be uncompressed and upload the plain 2GB disk.raw.
 Because of this the image is just created using 2GB and later needs to be expanded.</description>

      <title>What is Fabrik</title>

      <description>What is Fabrik ? A tool for creating and managing jails.
Why ? FreeBSD is a beast. Unfortunately few are capable of taking advantage all the benefits and capabilities available within it. It is a fact that for having a proper setup some work needs to be done. you don&amp;rsquo;t get diamonds by just putting carbon in the microwave and wait for a couple of minutes.
The idea behind Fabrik is to simplify the initial/bootstrap work (custom kernel + ZFS) and come with a ready to work image that can be used out of the box and create jails on demand.</description>
